    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>For those who believe that breakfast is the <em>most important meal of the day</em> this is an easy, adaptable way to give you that energetic start you need.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Porridge Flakes</li>
        <li>Cool drinking water</li>
        <li>Semi-skimmed milk</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Also needed:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Weighing Scales</li>
        <li>900W Microwave</li>
        <li>Microwave-safe bowl and spoons</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Pour 37 grams of flakes into the bowl and zero the scales.</li>
        <li>Add 105 grams of water. No need to stir yet!</li>
        <li>Now add 110 grams of milk. Stir gently for 10-15 seconds.</li>
        <li>Heat in microwave on full (900W) power for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir gently for 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Cook for another 30 seconds and stir again similarly.</li>
        <li>Repeat the previous step. Notice the porridge rising and ensure the bowl does not overflow.</li>
        <li>Continue with heating periods of 20 seconds each time --- the stirring can get more vigorous as the mixture begins to thicken.</li>
        <li>After about 4 periods of 20 seconds, the mixture will have significant thickness, so that it resists the motion of your spoon as you stir. When we reach this stage, stop cooking and leave the bowl out for 10 minutes to cool.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your porridge, possibly by adding pieces of fruit, although it is delicious on its own!</li>
        </ol>
